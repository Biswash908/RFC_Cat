      question: "Why does the raw feeding diet exclude vegetables and fruits?",
      answer:
        "Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they thrive on a diet of animal-based proteins and fats. Vegetables and fruits can stress their digestive system and are not naturally part of their diet.",

      question: "What should I do if my cat refuses to eat raw food?",
